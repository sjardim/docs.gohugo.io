In no particular order, here is what we are working on:

 * Intelligently Related Posts
 * Even easier deployment to S3, SSH, GitHub, rsync
 * Import from other website systems
    * from Drupal (See https://bitbucket.org/rickb777/drupal2hugo by Rick Beton (@rickb777))
    * from WordPress (See [#100][], especially https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter by Cyrill Schumacher (@SchumacherFM), but volunteers are needed to make it work with latest versions of WordPress.)
    * from Jekyll (See [#101][])
 * An interactive web based editor (See http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/web-based-editor/155)
 * Additional [themes](https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes) (always on-going, contributions welcome!)
 * Dynamic image resizing via shortcodes
 * Support for additional formats (AsciiDoc ([#470][], [#826][]), reST [#472][])
 * Pagination (See [#96][], [#750][])
 * And, last but not least, ***Your best ideas***!
