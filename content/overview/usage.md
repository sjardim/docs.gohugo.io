## Common Usage Example

The most common use is probably to run `hugo` with your current directory being the input directory:

    $ hugo
    0 draft content
    0 future content
    99 pages created
    0 paginator pages created
    16 tags created
    0 groups created
    in 120 ms

This generates your web site to the `public/` directory,
ready to be deployed to your web server.


## Instant feedback as you develop your web site

If you are working on things and want to see the changes immediately, tell Hugo to watch for changes.
Hugo will watch the filesystem for changes, and rebuild your site as soon as a file is saved:

    $ hugo -s ~/Code/hugo/docs --watch
    0 draft content
    0 future content
    99 pages created
    0 paginator pages created
    16 tags created
    0 groups created
    in 120 ms
    Watching for changes in /Users/spf13/Code/hugo/docs/content
    Press Ctrl+C to stop

Hugo can even run a server and create a site preview at the same time!
Hugo implements [LiveReload](/extras/livereload/) technology to automatically
reload any open pages in all JavaScript-enabled browsers, including mobile.
This is the easiest and most common way to develop a Hugo web site:

    $ hugo server -ws ~/Code/hugo/docs
    0 draft content
    0 future content
    99 pages created
    0 paginator pages created
    16 tags created
    0 groups created
    in 120 ms
    Watching for changes in /Users/spf13/Code/hugo/docs/content
    Serving pages from /Users/spf13/Code/hugo/docs/public
    Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/
    Press Ctrl+C to stop


## Deploying your web site

After running `hugo server` for local web development,
you need to do a final `hugo` run **without the `server` command**
and **without `--watch` or `-w`** to rebuild your site.
You may then **deploy your site** by copying the `public/` directory
(by FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Rsync, git push, etc.) to your production web server.

Since Hugo generates a static website, your site can be hosted anywhere,
including [Heroku][], [GoDaddy][], [DreamHost][], [GitHub Pages][],
[Amazon S3][] and [CloudFront][], or any other cheap or even free
static web hosting services.

[Apache][], [nginx][], [IIS][]...  Any web server software would do!

[Apache]: http://httpd.apache.org/ "Apache HTTP Server"
[nginx]: http://nginx.org/
[IIS]: http://www.iis.net/
[Heroku]: https://www.heroku.com/
[GoDaddy]: https://www.godaddy.com/
[DreamHost]: http://www.dreamhost.com/
[GitHub Pages]: https://pages.github.com/
[Amazon S3]: http://aws.amazon.com/s3/
[CloudFront]: http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/ "Amazon CloudFront"


### A note about deployment

Running `hugo` *does not* remove generated files before building. This means that you should delete your `public/` directory (or the directory you specified with `-d`/`--destination`) before running the `hugo` command, or you run the risk of the wrong files (e.g. drafts and/or future posts) being left in the generated site.

An easy way to work around this is to use different directories for development and production.

To start a server that builds draft content (helpful for editing), you can specify a different destination: the `dev/` dir.

    hugo server -wDs ~/Code/hugo/docs -d dev

When the content is ready for publishing, use the default `public/` dir:

    hugo -s ~/Code/hugo/docs

This prevents content you're not ready to share yet from accidentally becoming available.

### Alternatively, serve your web site with Hugo!

Yes, that's right!  Because Hugo is so blazingly fast both in web site creation
*and* in web serving (thanks to its concurrent and multi-threaded design and
its Go heritage), some users actually prefer using Hugo itself to serve their
web site *on their production server*!

No other web server software (Apache, nginx, IIS...) is necessary.

Here is the command:

    hugo server --watch \
                --baseURL=http://yoursite.org/ --port=80 \
                --appendPort=false \
                --bind=87.245.198.50

Note the `bind` option, which is the interface to which the server will bind (defaults to `127.0.0.1`, which is fine for most development use cases). Some hosts, like Amazon WS, runs network address translation and it can sometimes be hard to figure out the actual IP address. Using `--bind=0.0.0.0` will bind to all interfaces.

This way, you may actually deploy just the source files,
and Hugo on your server will generate the resulting web site
on-the-fly and serve them at the same time.

You may optionally add `--disableLiveReload=true` if you do not want
the JavaScript code for LiveReload to be added to your web pages.
